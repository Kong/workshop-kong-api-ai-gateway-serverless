For Prompt Engineering use cases, Kong AI Gateway provides:
* **AI Prompt Decorator** plugin: it injects messages at the start or end of a caller's chat history.
* **AI Prompt Guard** plugin: it lets you configure a series of PCRE-compatible regular expressions to allow and block specific prompts, words, phrases, or otherwise and have more control over the LLM.
* **AI Prompt Template** plugin: it's responsible for pre-configuring AI prompts to users


All plugins extend the functionality of the **AI Proxy** plugin, and requires **AI Proxy** to be configured first.


You can now click **Next** to proceed further.
