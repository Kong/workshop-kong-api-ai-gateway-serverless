For today workshop, we will be focusing on Kong Gateway.
Kong Gateway data plane listen for traffic on the proxy port 443 by default. The data plane evaluates incoming client API requests and routes them to the appropriate backend APIs. While routing requests and providing responses, policies can be applied with plugins as necessary.
