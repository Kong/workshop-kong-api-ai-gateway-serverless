In this chapter we are going to explore the following common use cases we typically implement at the API Gateway Layer. 

* Proxy caching
* API Key with Kong Consumers
* Rate Limiting using Redis
* Request Transformer
* Request Callout
* OpenID Connect with Keycloak
* Access Control with Open Policy Agent (OPA)

These functionalities are extended by the use of Kong Plugins. You can find a full list of all Kong plugins on the [Plugin Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/).
