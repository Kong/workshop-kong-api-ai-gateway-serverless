    <title>API Management with Kong Konnect</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/index.html</link>
    <description>Introduction Kong Konnect is an API lifecycle management platform delivered as a service. The management plane is hosted in the cloud by Kong, while the runtime environments are deployed in your personal environment. Management plane enables customers to securely execute API management activities such as create API routes, define services etc. Runtime environments connect with the management plane using mutual transport layer authentication (mTLS), receive the updates and take customer facing API traffic.</description>

      <title>Kong Konnect Architectural Overview</title>

      <description>The Kong Konnect platform provides a cloud control plane (CP), which manages all service configurations. It propagates those configurations to all Runtime control planes, which use in-memory storage. These nodes can be installed anywhere, on-premise or in AWS.&#xA;For today workshop, we will be focusing on Kong Gateway. Kong Gateway data plane listen for traffic on the proxy port 443 by default. The data plane evaluates incoming client API requests and routes them to the appropriate backend APIs. While routing requests and providing responses, policies can be applied with plugins as necessary.</description>

      <description>This chapter will walk you through&#xA;Konnect Control Plane and Data Plane creation using Kong Gateway Operator (KGO). Scale Kong data plane nodes on Kubernetes using HPA - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. Access Kong data plane through Minikube tunnel Here’s a Reference Architecture that will be implemented in this workshop:&#xA;Kong Konnect Control Plane: responsible for managing your APIs Kong Konnect Data Plane: connected to the Control Plane, it is responsible for processing all the incoming requests sent by the consumers. Kong provides a plugin framework, where each one of them is responsible for a specific functionality. As a can see, there are two main collections of plugins: On the left, the historic and regular API Gateway plugins, implementing all sort of policies including, for example, OIDC based Authentication processes with Keycloak, Amazon Cognito and Okta or Observability with Prometheus/Grafana and Dynatrace. On the right, another plugin collection for AI-based use cases. For example, the AI Rate Limiting plugin implements policies like this based on the number of tokens consumed be the requests. Or, as another example is the AI Semantic Cache plugin, which caches data based on the semantics related to the responses coming from the LLM models. Kong AI Gateway supports, out of the box, a variety of infrastructures, including not just OpenAI, but also Amazon Bedrock, Google Gemini, Mistral, Anthropic, etc. In order to deal with embeddings, the Gateway also supports also vector databases. Kong Gateway protects not just the LLM Models but also the upstream services, including your application micros surfaces or services. Konnect Control Plane After Konnect registration, you need to create your first Control Plane. There are multiple ways to do it:</description>

      <description>With our Control Plane created and Data Plane layer deployed it’s time to create an API and expose an application. In this module, we will:&#xA;Deploy an application to get protected by the Data Plane Use decK to define a Kong Service based on an endpoint provided by the application and a Kong Route on top of the Kong Service to expose the application. Enable Kong Plugins to the Kong Route or Kong Service. Define Kong Consumers to represent the entities sending request to the Gateway and enable Kong Plugin to them. With decK (declarations for Kong) you can manage Kong Konnect configuration in a declaratively way.</description>
