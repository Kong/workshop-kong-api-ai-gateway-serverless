    <title>API Management with Kong Konnect and Serverless API Gateway</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/index.html</link>
    <description>Introduction Kong Konnect is an API lifecycle management platform delivered as a service. The management plane is hosted in the cloud by Kong. The management plane enables customers to securely execute API management activities such as create API routes, define services etc. Runtime environments connect with the management plane using mutual transport layer authentication (mTLS), receive the updates and take customer facing API traffic.&#xA;The runtime environments can be:&#xA;Self-managed and deployed in your personal environment Managed by Kong in two options: Dedicated Cloud Gateway: it runs on isolated infrastructure within Kong-managed environments in AWS, Azure, or GCP offering the performance and security of dedicated infrastructure with the operational ease of SaaS. Serverless Gateway: it is a lightweight API gateways, ideal for developers who want to test or experiment in a pre-production environment.

      <title>Kong Konnect Architectural Overview</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/architecture/index.html</link>

      <description>The Kong Konnect platform provides a cloud control plane (CP), which manages all service configurations. It propagates those configurations to all Runtime control planes, which use in-memory storage. These nodes can be installed anywhere, on-premise or in AWS.&#xA;For today workshop, we will be focusing on Kong Gateway. Kong Gateway data plane listen for traffic on the proxy port 443 by default. The data plane evaluates incoming client API requests and routes them to the appropriate backend APIs. While routing requests and providing responses, policies can be applied with plugins as necessary.</description>

      <description>This chapter will walk you through&#xA;Konnect Control Plane and Data Plane. Access Kong Data Plane. Here’s a Reference Architecture that will be implemented in this workshop:&#xA;Kong Konnect Control Plane: responsible for managing your APIs Kong Konnect Data Plane: connected to the Control Plane, it is responsible for processing all the incoming requests sent by the consumers. Kong provides a plugin framework, where each one of them is responsible for a specific functionality. As a can see, there are two main collections of plugins: On the left, the historic and regular API Gateway plugins, implementing all sort of policies including, for example, OIDC based Authentication processes with Keycloak, Amazon Cognito and Okta or Observability with Prometheus/Grafana and Dynatrace. On the right, another plugin collection for AI-based use cases. For example, the AI Rate Limiting plugin implements policies like this based on the number of tokens consumed be the requests. Or, as another example is the AI Semantic Cache plugin, which caches data based on the semantics related to the responses coming from the LLM models. Kong AI Gateway supports, out of the box, a variety of infrastructures, including not just OpenAI, but also Amazon Bedrock, Google Gemini, Mistral, Anthropic, etc. In order to deal with embeddings, the Gateway also supports also vector databases. Kong Gateway protects not just the LLM Models but also the upstream services, including your application micros surfaces or services. Konnect Control Planes Kong Konnect is the main Kong offering for hybrid deployments, including:</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/12-api-gateway/index.html</guid>
      <description>With our Control Plane created and Data Plane layer deployed it’s time to create an API and expose an application. In this module, we will:&#xA;Use Konnect UI to import an OpenAPI specification. Use decK to define a Kong Service based on an endpoint provided by the application and a Kong Route on top of the Kong Service to expose the application. Enable Kong Plugins to the Kong Route or Kong Service. Define Kong Consumers to represent the entities sending request to the Gateway and enable Kong Plugin to them. With decK (declarations for Kong) you can manage Kong Konnect configuration in a declaratively way.</description>

      <title>APIOps and decK</title>

      <description>Concept APIOps applies DevOps principles (automation, version control, CI/CD) to API lifecycle management. Here’s a diagrama describing an APIOps lifecycle with Kong Technologies.&#xA;There are 3 main steps used to deliver APIs to Kong Gateway. These workflows are completed in sequence, with administrator approval between each step. Completion of final workflow results in a deployed API to Kong Konnect.&#xA;OpenAPI to Kong: This step takes an OpenAPI specification and converts it to a decK file that can be used by Kong Gateway. Additionally, service specific patches are applied to the decK file allowing administrators to set overrides for specific APIs. Stage decK changes: This step takes the decK file generated by the OpenAPI to Kong step and compares it to the current state of the Kong Gateway. It generates a diff and stages the changes as a PR. decK sync: This step is triggered by the merging of deck configuration files to the main branch (by the previous workflow PR approval). The step triggers a deck gateway sync command on the configuration files and applies the changes to Kong Gateway. decK and APIOps With Kong Konnect and decK, APIs can be treated as code — versioned, tested, and deployed through pipelines.</description>

      <description>The Konnect Developer Portal is a customizable website for developers to locate, access, and consume API services. It enables developers to browse and search API documentation, try API operations, and manage their own credentials. The Portal supports both internal and external APIs through flexible deployment options.&#xA;Dev Portal APIs allow you to publish APIs using OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specifications and Markdown documentation. You can provide highly customizable content at both the site and API level to offer additional context to developers.</description>
