    <title>APIOps and decK :: API Management with Kong Konnect and Serverless API Gateway</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/14-apiops-deck/index.html</link>
    <description>Concept APIOps applies DevOps principles (automation, version control, CI/CD) to API lifecycle management. Here’s a diagrama describing an APIOps lifecycle with Kong Technologies.&#xA;There are 3 main steps used to deliver APIs to Kong Gateway. These workflows are completed in sequence, with administrator approval between each step. Completion of final workflow results in a deployed API to Kong Konnect.&#xA;OpenAPI to Kong: This step takes an OpenAPI specification and converts it to a decK file that can be used by Kong Gateway. Additionally, service specific patches are applied to the decK file allowing administrators to set overrides for specific APIs. Stage decK changes: This step takes the decK file generated by the OpenAPI to Kong step and compares it to the current state of the Kong Gateway. It generates a diff and stages the changes as a PR. decK sync: This step is triggered by the merging of deck configuration files to the main branch (by the previous workflow PR approval). The step triggers a deck gateway sync command on the configuration files and applies the changes to Kong Gateway. decK and APIOps With Kong Konnect and decK, APIs can be treated as code — versioned, tested, and deployed through pipelines.</description>
