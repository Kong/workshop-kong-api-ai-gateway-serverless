    <title>Kong API Gateway :: API Management with Kong Konnect</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/12-api-gateway/index.html</link>
    <description>With our Control Plane created and Data Plane layer deployed itâ€™s time to create an API and expose an application. In this module, we will:&#xA;Deploy an application to get protected by the Data Plane Use decK to define a Kong Service based on an endpoint provided by the application and a Kong Route on top of the Kong Service to expose the application. Enable Kong Plugins to the Kong Route or Kong Service. Define Kong Consumers to represent the entities sending request to the Gateway and enable Kong Plugin to them. With decK (declarations for Kong) you can manage Kong Konnect configuration in a declaratively way.</description>

      <description>Gateway Services represent the upstream services in your system. These applications are the business logic components of your system responsible for responding to requests.&#xA;The configuration of a Gateway Service defines the connectivity details between the Kong Gateway and the upstream service, along with other metadata. Generally, you should map one Gateway Service to each upstream service.&#xA;For simple deployments, the upstream URL can be provided directly in the Gateway Service. For sophisticated traffic management needs, a Gateway Service can point at an Upstream.</description>

      <description>In this chapter we are going to explore the following common use cases we typically implement at the API Gateway Layer.&#xA;Proxy caching API Key with Kong Consumers Rate Limiting using Redis Request Transformer Request Callout OpenID Connect with Keycloak Access Control with Open Policy Agent (OPA) These functionalities are extended by the use of Kong Plugins. You can find a full list of all Kong plugins on the Plugin Hub.</description>
