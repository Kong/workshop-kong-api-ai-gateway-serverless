      <description>Basically Konnect provides two main Builtin Observability services:&#xA;Konnect Advanced Analytics: it is a real-time, contextual analytics platform that provides insights into API health, performance, and usage.&#xA;Konnect Debugger: it provides a connected debugging experience and real-time trace-level visibility into API traffic.</description>

      <description>The external Observability infrastructure we are going to use is based on the OpenTelemetry standard and it comprises:&#xA;OTel Collector: implements the component responsible for receiving, processing and exporting telemetry data. Loki: plays the log processing role and receiving all requests and responses processed by the Kong API and AI Gateway Data Plane. Prometheus: responsible for scraping and storing the metrics the Kong API and AI Gateway generate. Grafana: used to query and analyze logs and metrics. Jaeger: distributed tracing platform.</description>
