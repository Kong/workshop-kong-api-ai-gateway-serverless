    <title>Konnect Developer Portal :: API Management with Kong Konnect and Serverless API Gateway</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/15-developer-portal/index.html</link>
    <description>The Konnect Developer Portal is a customizable website for developers to locate, access, and consume API services. It enables developers to browse and search API documentation, try API operations, and manage their own credentials. The Portal supports both internal and external APIs through flexible deployment options.&#xA;Dev Portal APIs allow you to publish APIs using OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specifications and Markdown documentation. You can provide highly customizable content at both the site and API level to offer additional context to developers.</description>

That’s needed to solve the relationship between the Dev Portal and the Upstream Service. Dev Portal creation Choose the Dev Portal menu option and click + Create a new portal. Create a Private Portal named portal1. In the New Portal page accept the default values and click Save Click Go to overview. You should see the Overview page of your portal Check the Portal configuration: User authentication: Konnect built-in - That defines the default mechanism the Dev Portal uses for the user authentication. Besides the build-in option, it can be configured as OIDC or SAML. Default authentication strategy: key-auth - That defines the mechanism to control the API consumption inside the Dev Portal. Test your Dev Portal Sign Up If you click on the Dev Portal URL, you will play the Developer role and see your new portal home page. Since there’s no developer created, click Sing up and register to the Portal. Type your name and use a real email since the Dev Portal will send a confirmation request to it.</description>
