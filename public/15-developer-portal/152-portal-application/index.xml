    <title>Developer Self-Service and Appication Registration :: API Management with Kong Konnect and Serverless API Gateway</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/15-developer-portal/152-portal-application/index.html</link>
    <description>This section will explore the Developer self-service and App registration capabilities provided by Konnect Developer Portal.&#xA;Go to APIs -&gt; Gateway Service. Link the API to the Kong Gateway Service. Show the Konnect App Auth plugin is enabled to the Service. You can link to a Konnect Gateway Service to allow developers to create applications and generate credentials or API keys. This is available to data planes running Kong Gateway 3.6 or later. When you link a service with an API, Konnect automatically adds the Konnect Application Auth (KAA) plugin on that Service. The KAA plugin is responsible for applying authentication and authorization on the Service. The authentication strategy that you select for the API defines how clients authenticate. While you can’t directly modify the KAA plugin as it’s managed by Konnect, you can modify the plugin’s behavior by adding JSON to the advanced configuration of your application auth strategy.</description>
